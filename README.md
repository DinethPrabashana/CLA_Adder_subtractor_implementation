# CLA Adder-Subtractor Digital Circuit

This project implements a digital circuit that can perform both addition and subtraction of binary numbers using a Carry Look-Ahead (CLA) adder. The circuit uses advanced logic to improve the speed of arithmetic operations by reducing the propagation delay associated with carry generation.

## Circuit Description

### Features
- **Addition Mode:** Adds two binary numbers.
- **Subtraction Mode:** Subtracts the second binary number from the first.
- **Mode Selector:** A control input that determines whether the circuit operates in addition or subtraction mode.
